# Airbnb-Bookings-Analysis-EDA

1. Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on travelling possibilities and present a more unique, personalised way of experiencing the world.

2. Today Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. 

3. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analysed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behaviour and performance on the platform.

4. I have performed a detailed exploratory data analysis and visualisation on the Airbnb bookings dataset and have tried to extract key understandings from the data.
